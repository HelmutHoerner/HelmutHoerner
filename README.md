# About me

From 1999-2015 I was responsible first as Managing Shareholder of Cato Software Solutions (a Medical Software Company), later as Quality Director of BD Austria, for the successful implementation and certification of a Quality Management System compliant with ISO 13495:2012, ISO 13485 (CMDCAS), ISO 9001, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, GAMP5, MDD, CMDR and HIPAA.

Since 2015 I provide consultancy services in this domain.

Looking for a new challenge, I also started studying physics at the Vienna University of Technology in 2015, where I got my Masters (Dipl.-Ing.) degree in 2021. 

Besides my consulting activities, I now also work as an University and Teaching Assistant (Univ.-Ass) at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (TU Wien) and as a Project Assistant at the Applied Quantum Physics Research Unit at the Institute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics. My current research domains are: Complex scattering, non-Hermitian photonics, wavefront shaping, and quantum vacuum forces.
